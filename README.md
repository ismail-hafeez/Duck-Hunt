# Duck-Hunt

The famous arcade game made in assembly 8086 in DosBox using MASM.

It's a simple game; a duck moves across the screen and you use the mouse cursor to click on it, to register a 'hit'. One hit = 2 points.

Mode 1:
- The user has 5 bullets.
•	To advance to the next round, you need to score at least 6 points.
•	The difficulty level is easy, with the duck flying at a slower pace.

Mode 2:
•	The user has 3 bullets
•	The duck flies at a faster pace, increasing the challenge.
•	The user needs to score 4 points to complete this mode and end the game.

Due to the complexity of the game, coupled with the short deadline and other projects at hand, there is however, one tiny logical problem. The click only seems to work _**after**_ the duck has registered a move from left to right. 

For file handling purposes, a 'text.txt' needs to be created and places in the MP folder or where ever the mounted directory lies.

Goodluck!
